Calculate fatigue strength of selected machine elements. Demo version.

The application calculates, creates Haigh graphs and comes up with a suggested solution. The subject is a bar loaded in a sinusoidal manner in the function of time with constant repetitive loads. Program is aimed at help for students. It include four instance. Each occurrence depend on kind of loads.

Project created with Polish desctription.
